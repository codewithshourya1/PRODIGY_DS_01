# PRODIGY_DS_01 - Task 1 

this project is part of my intrenship of data science at prodigy infotech 

this project is Python-based data visualization script that demonstrates how to generate and analyze a s dataset representing population demographics. It shows the distribution of *ages* (a continuous variable) and *genders* (a categorical variable) using *histograms* and *bar charts*.

The project creates:

•⁠  ⁠A *Histogram* for Age Distribution  
•⁠  ⁠A *Bar Chart* for Gender Distribution

Plots are generated using the Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries.

## Technologies Used

•⁠  ⁠Python 3.12
•⁠  ⁠NumPy
•⁠  ⁠Pandas
•⁠  ⁠Matplotlib
•⁠  ⁠Seaborn

## How It Works

1.⁠ ⁠Random data is generated:
   - *Ages* between 10 and 80 for 500 individuals.
   - *Genders* randomly selected as Male or Female.
2.⁠ ⁠A DataFrame is created using pandas.
3.⁠ ⁠A *histogram* visualizes age distribution.
4.⁠ ⁠A *bar chart* visualizes gender count.
